    *  What do you think the Big O of the two processText methods are for each kind of Set?
    
    Sorted: O(N^2.75)
    Unsorted: O(N)
    HashSet: O(log(N))
    TreeSet: O(log(N))
    
    
    * Can Big O be meaningful when the data type sent to a method can vary? How do you address this problem?
    Yes, to a point.  It gives a rough estimate but it can still vary greatly depending on the data type.  Specialize the methods for each task.
    
    * What are the Big Os of your add methods? What do you think the Big O of the HashSet and TreeSet add methods are?
    
    Sorted: O(N^2)
    Unsorted: O(N)
    HashSet:  O(log(N))
    TreeSet:  O(log(N))
    * What are the differences between HashSet and TreeSet when printing out the contents of the Set?
    Hash set prints the contents unordered.  Tree set prints the contents in sorted order.
